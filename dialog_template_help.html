        <h3>Kwantos Help</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Kwantos, the "Are there more?" game.</p>
        <p>The game can be configured for 1 to 4 players, and a game lasts ten rounds. The player with the most
            points at the end of the tenth round is declared the winner.</p>
        <p>Each player in each round will be asked a question form: "Are there more <i>items in location</i> that
            contain the word <i>"word1"</i> or the word <i>"word2"</i>?" For example, Kwantos may ask, "Are there
            more books in the Library of Congress with the word "blue" or the word "red"?"</p>
        <p>The player then selects how much of his current score to bet (based on how confident the player is
            in their answer), and selects one of the two words.  Kwantos will check the web and find out the
            right answer, and the player will either be awarded or penalized the amount of their bet.</p>
